<h1>Responding To A Phishing Attack Using Playbook</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

In this activity, I was asked to review the following scenario and then follow playbook instructions to investigate and resolve the phishing incident's alert ticket:

You are a level-one security operations center (SOC) analyst at a financial services company. Previously, you received a phishing alert about a suspicious file being downloaded on an employee's computer. After investigating the email attachment file's hash, the attachment has already been verified malicious. Now that you have this information, you must follow your organization's process to complete your investigation and resolve the alert.

Your organization's security policies and procedures describe how to respond to specific alerts, including what to do when you receive a phishing alert. 

In the playbook, there is a flowchart and written instructions to help you complete your investigation and resolve the alert. At the end of your investigation, you will update the alert ticket with your findings about the incident. 

Be sure to address the following steps in your completed activity:  
- In the Alert ticket, update the Ticket status column using the dropdown list.
- In the Ticket comments section in the Alert ticket, provide a sentence briefly describing the alert and what happened.
- In the Ticket comments section in the Alert ticket, provide 2-3 sentences describing the reasons why you chose to escalate or close the ticket. Support your reasons using specific details from the alert ticket.
